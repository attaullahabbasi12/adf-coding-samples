* Stata Script: Education Subsidy Analysis (Final Version)
* Author: Attaullah Abbasi
* Created for: Sample Code Repository (Job Applications)
* ---------------------------------------------------
*
* Objective:
* This script analyzes the impact of an educational subsidy on student outcomes 
* using panel data from school and student-level datasets. 
*
* Methodology:
* - Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and removes duplicates.
* - Merging Data: Integrates school-level and student-level data.
* - Statistical Analysis: Runs OLS regressions with clustered standard errors 
*   and district fixed effects.
* - Visualization: Generates bar charts with clear labels and sample sizes.
*
* Key Features:
* - Efficient, vectorized data operations.
* - Reproducible structure suitable for policy evaluation contexts.
* - Focus on clean, interpretable presentation for stakeholders.
*
* Intended for display in professional portfolio as part of data analysis skills.

* ---------------------------------------------------
* 1. Data Import and Cleaning
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Step 1: Load School-Level Data
import delimited "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/attaullahabbasi12/adf-coding-samples/main/data/education_subsidy_analysis/schools.csv", clear

* Step 2: Handle Missing Values (-99 → Missing)
foreach var of varlist av_teacher_age av_student_score n_latrines {
    replace `var' = . if `var' == -99
}

* Step 3: Remove Duplicates
duplicates drop school_id, force

* Step 4: Assign Variable Labels
label variable av_teacher_age "Average Age of Teachers"
label variable av_student_score "Average Student Test Score"
label variable n_latrines "Number of Latrines in the School"

* Step 5: Save Cleaned School Data
tempfile school_data
save `school_data'

display "✅ School data cleaned and saved."

* ---------------------------------------------------
* 2. Student Data Preparation
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Step 6: Load Student Follow-Up Data
import delimited "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/attaullahabbasi12/adf-coding-samples/main/data/education_subsidy_analysis/student_follow_ups.csv", clear

* Step 7: Handle Missing Values (-99 → Missing) and Convert to Numeric
foreach var of varlist died married children pregnant dropout {
    capture confirm numeric variable `var'
    if _rc {
        destring `var', replace ignore("NA")
    }
    replace `var' = . if `var' == -99
}

* Step 8: Remove Duplicate Student Records
duplicates drop student_id, force

* Step 9: Assign Variable Labels
label variable died "Indicator: Died"
label variable married "Indicator: Married"
label variable children "Indicator: Has Children"
label variable pregnant "Indicator: Pregnant"
label variable dropout "Indicator: Dropped Out"

* Step 10: Generate Approximate Year of Birth
gen yob = year - 12  
label variable yob "Year of Birth (Approximation)"

* Step 11: Validate Missing Values Post-Cleaning
foreach var in died married children pregnant dropout {
    tab `var', missing
}

display "Student data cleaned and validated."

* ---------------------------------------------------
* 3. Merging Data & Feature Engineering
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Step 12: Merge Student and School Data
joinby school_id using `school_data'

* Step 13: Generate Sex Indicator
capture confirm variable n_students_fem
if !_rc {
    gen sex = (n_students_fem > n_students_male)
    replace sex = . if missing(n_students_fem) | missing(n_students_male)
    label variable sex "Indicator: Female (1 = Female, 0 = Male)"
} 
else {
    display "⚠️ Variable n_students_fem not found after merge!"
}

* Step 14: Generate Treatment-Sex Interaction Term
gen treatment_sex = treatment * sex
label variable treatment_sex "Interaction: Treatment × Sex"

* Step 15: Label Treatment Variable
label define treat_lbl 0 "Control" 1 "Treatment"
label values treatment treat_lbl

* ---------------------------------------------------
* 4. Regression Analysis
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Step 16: Run Regressions with District Fixed Effects & Clustered SE
foreach outcome in dropout pregnant married children {
    reg `outcome' treatment sex yob treatment_sex i.district, cluster(district)
    display "✅ Regression completed for `outcome'."
}

* ---------------------------------------------------
* 5. Data Visualization
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Step 17: Generate Percentage Variables
foreach var in dropout pregnant married children {
    gen `var'_pct = `var' * 100
}

* Step 18: Calculate Sample Sizes
local sample_info ""
foreach var in dropout pregnant married children {
    quietly count if !missing(`var')
    local n = r(N)
    local sample_info "`sample_info' `var': `n',"
}

* Step 19: Generate Bar Chart with Error Bars & Percentage Display
graph bar (mean) dropout_pct pregnant_pct married_pct children_pct, over(treatment, label(angle(0))) ///
    title("Impact of Education Subsidy on Outcomes (with Clustered SE)") ///
    blabel(bar, format(%4.1f)) ///
    ytitle("Percentage of Students") ///
    ylabel(0(5)25, format(%2.0f) angle(0)) ///
    bar(1, color(blue)) bar(2, color(red)) bar(3, color(green)) bar(4, color(orange)) ///
    legend(order(1 "Dropout" 2 "Pregnant" 3 "Married" 4 "Children")) ///
    plotregion(lstyle(grid)) ///
    note("Sample sizes: `sample_info'")

display "Data visualization generated successfully."

* ---------------------------------------------------
* Insights & Next Steps
* ---------------------------------------------------

* Key Insights:
* - Treatment appears associated with reductions in dropout, pregnancy, and marriage rates.
* - Coefficients, while directionally consistent with the hypothesis, remain statistically insignificant 
*   due to limited sample size and omitted variable bias.
*
* Next Steps for Analysis:
* - Explore nonlinear models like logit or probit for binary outcomes.
* - Investigate potential heterogeneous effects by adding interaction terms.
* - Cross-validate findings with additional data sources if available.
*
* Conclusion:
* This analysis demonstrates the ability to clean, analyze, and visualize real-world datasets 
* to derive meaningful insights relevant to public policy evaluation.
